# Dataset credit
This project is based around the FMA dataset as well as some utilities found within the project [here](https://github.com/mdeff/fma). For access to files and source of the dataset please visit https://github.com/mdeff/fma.

# Overview

Deep learning based recognizer of musical genres for songs. Currently two versions of the model are available a multi-layer perceptron trained on the features extracted from the FMA dataset and a convolutional neural network trained on raw decoded mp3s. This README contains instructions on how to use pretrained models available in this repository as well as train your own on the FMA data.

Any work with these scripts require activating the conda environment which contains all the prerequisite libraries. You can do so by running 
```
conda env create -f genre_recognizer.yml
conda activate genre_recognizer
 ```
